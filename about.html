            <p>
                Ya Haddy Kasseh, that’s my name. A 6 feet 3 inches (6’3) tall, black and beautiful young lady who’s from a comfortable family and an outstanding background. I am 21 years’ old, I was born and raised at Kanifing south but later moved to costal road to our own comfy home were am still living with my family.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am a high school graduate, I actually didn’t make it with good grades during my final year but never loosen my belt or sit still to say this is the end of it. I took part in the MDI Access program for almost a year just to re amend my mistakes and further my education. Despite all that I’m actually proud of the woman am becoming, I am currently studying computer science at Management Development Institute (MDI) which is almost at the finishing level (currently in my 3rd semester one more semester to go). After that i would love to further my curse in The University Of The Gambia (UTG) to have more knowledge, skills and experience because I don’t like the idea of working for organizations, all I have ever wanted is to be independent someday and specialize on my own profession to make enough funds.
            </p>

            <p>
                I deeply have affection for fashion and I believe the saying that money can buy happiness so my wish and dreams are to successfully build up a career, do all it takes to achieve my goals make lot of money and live life as I should insallah.
            </p>

            <h1>
                A little history
            </h1>

            <p>
                In this aspect I don’t have much to say because I came from a comfortable family were I would not say everything was available, but at least all the most needed ones were provided for me by my mother my hero, who am so thankful and grateful for and I pray for her long life, wealth and prosperity so that I will be able to make her prod someday insallah. (My educational background) I spent my entire schooling life in the same school, I attended Ndow’s comprehensive from nursery to high school a typical Ndow’s product indeed, and I would say it was a lifetime experience that I will never forget, as for now it was the best 12 years of my life because I had nothing to worry about compare to now with all the challenges and struggles I have to face as a grown lady.
